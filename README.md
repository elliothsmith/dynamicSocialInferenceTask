# Background
This repo includes Matlab files needed to run a dynamic social inference task. During each trial, subjects watch a popular movie clip in which a full sentence is spoken and a salient emotion is displayed. Following a delay period, the subject must respond to either a question about the emotional or semantic content of the clip. 

# Flow
`mainTask.m` is the main task file. It calls various setup files. The task is currently set up to record gaze position with a TOBII eye tracker.
